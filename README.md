Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
--The problem I was originally having with the project was making the class variables work correctly. Passing by reference and using pointers seemed to be the most 
--efficient and practical solution to this problem.
What did you do particularly well?
--I think the thing i did be was keep the code within main to a minimum. I also implimented the use of being able to 
--repeat the calculator well
Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
--The only real enhancement I feel there could have been would be to implement a way to change the conditions of th eloan individually.
Did you find writing any piece of this code challenging, and how did you overcome this? What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support
network?
--There was nothing that was challenging as far as the writing is concerned. 
What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or course work?
--I think the implementation of using the class and passing by reference and use of pointers was good practice.
How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
--Through proper spacing within the code and proper implementation of class files.
